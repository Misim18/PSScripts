# PSScripts
A collection of powershell scripts I find useful

## Sort_images_by_creation: 
This script has you select a directory and then sorts the contained files based on their 'Optagelsesdato'/'Recordingdate' - usefull if you've been travelling and taking pictures across different devices, to sort them based on when the images were actually taken. 

**Note:** If the script is run on a non-danish machine the metadata attribute will probably be named differently.
