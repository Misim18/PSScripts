# PSScripts
A collection of powershell scripts I find useful

Scripts: 
Sort_images_by_creation allows you to select a folder on your machine, the script will then collect all metadata available for the files contained in that folder, and sort them based on the 'Optagelsesdato'/'Recordingdate'. If the script is run on a non-danish machine the metadata attribute will probably be named differently.
