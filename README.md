# PSScripts
A collection of powershell scripts I find useful

## Sort_images_by_creation: 
A script that allows you to select a directory to then sorts the contained files based on their 'Optagelsesdato'/'Recordingdate' - Particularly usefull if you've been travelling and taking pictures across different devices, to sort them based on when the images creation tag. 

**Note:** 
1) If the script is run on a non-danish machine the metadata attribute will probably be named differently. 
2) The script takes a few minutes to execute, however I imagine you run it once per vacation, so I haven't felt the need to optimze it further.
